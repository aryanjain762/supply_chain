# Supply Chain Optimizer

This is a Flask-based web application that helps optimize supply chain operations using AI-powered recommendations. It provides tools for transportation optimization, production planning, and decision support. The app integrates with the Groq API to generate actionable insights.

## Features

- **Transportation Optimization**: Get optimized routing plans, cost savings, and strategies for logistics.
- **Production Planning**: Generate production schedules, buffer inventory levels, and bottleneck mitigation strategies.
- **Decision Support**: Ask supply chain-related questions and get actionable recommendations.
- **Chart Visualization**: View production volume data in a simple chart format.

## How It Works

1. **Transportation Optimization**:
   - Input origin locations, destination locations, shipment volumes, and constraints.
   - The app generates an optimized logistics plan with cost savings and strategies.

2. **Production Planning**:
   - Input products, demand forecasts, production capacity, and lead times.
   - The app provides a production schedule, buffer inventory levels, and bottleneck analysis.

3. **Decision Support**:
   - Ask a supply chain-related question and provide context (optional).
   - The app returns a clear recommendation with rationale and risks.

4. **Chart Data**:
   - View production volume data over time in a simple chart.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Groq API key (get it from [Groq](https://groq.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supply-chain-optimizer.git
   cd supply-chain-optimizer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API key:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the app.

## API Endpoints

## Example Requests

### Transportation Optimization
```json
{
  "origins": ["New York", "Chicago"],
  "destinations": ["Dallas", "Phoenix"],
  "volumes": [5000, 3000],
  "constraints": "Must deliver within 3 days"
}
```

### Production Planning
```json
{
  "products": ["Widget A", "Widget B"],
  "demand": [1000, 2000],
  "capacity": {
    "Widget A": "500/day",
    "Widget B": "700/day"
  },
  "lead_times": {
    "Widget A": 3,
    "Widget B": 5
  }
}
```

### Decision Support
```json
{
  "question": "Should we add another distribution center in the Midwest?",
  "context": {
    "current_dc_locations": ["East Coast", "West Coast"],
    "annual_volume": "1.2M units",
    "current_delivery_times": "3-5 days"
  }
}
```

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Backend framework for handling API requests.
- **Groq API**: AI-powered recommendations for supply chain optimization.
- **Chart.js**: Visualization of production data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling for the frontend (if you add a frontend later).
